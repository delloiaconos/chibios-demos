# ChibiOS - DEMOS

A set of demos made for ChibiOS/RT 21.11.x (Vettica) + HAL stable branch.
These examples have been tested on ChibiStudio 2023-02 for Windows. 


ChibiStudio version: [Sourceforge ChibStudio Project](https://sourceforge.net/projects/chibios/files/ChibiStudio%20Windows/ChibiStudio_Windows_2023-02.7z)

ChibiOS version: [ChibiOS 21.11.x](https://github.com/ChibiOS/ChibiOS/tree/stable_21.11.x)

These examples are cured by Salvatore Dello Iacono and other.

This is a set of more complex examples (demos) compared to the [chibios-examples](https://github.com/delloiaconos/chibios-examples) repository.
To run these demos it's required a STM32-NUCLEO64 board (different version depending on the project) and additional hardware.
